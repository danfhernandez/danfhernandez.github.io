title: Back to the Basics: 3 Agile Practices to Get Right 
---

Believe it or not, you can start a transformation from any position within an organization. You can be an individual contributor, like a software engineer, manager, managing director… it doesn't matter. Decision-making power helps, but those with more decision making power often lack the exposure to the true problems organizations face and the work teams do. 

In the next few blog posts I'll be sharing some key principles to follow and steps you can take that will improve the performance of your team, enable you as an agent of change and ultimately provide an example for other teams to learn from.

Before you do anything else, building a strong foundation with some basic Agile practices is critical. This will provide the engine to keep you moving along. So let's start by talking about what is and what isn't Agile.

## What isn't Agile?  

Agile isn't Scrum.. at least not always. I mention this because it the most pervasive misconception about Agile.  "If we do Scrum we are Agile" is a common thought pattern and it's typically when this is thought, that it isn't. 

Agile is not any pattern, practice, framework or activity. 

## What is Agile?

So if Agile isn't just Scrum, what is it?

Agile is a methodology that has many frameworks, practices, and activities with similar values and goals in mind. If you haven't seen the Agile Manifesto, take a look here: https://agilemanifesto.org. It speaks to the high level methodology.

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is an Agile framework. You can practice Agile without practicing Scrum. And yes, when done right, a team using Scrum can certainly be Agile. 

It's all about how it's framed. 

Here's a quote from an Agile team using Scrum explaining why they chose it: "We take a look at our process regularly and decide what's working for us and what's not, currently many of the practices in the Scrum framework are working for us." 

## Most Important
What's most important is that each team should have a choice and decide what to experiment with and adopt. What works for one team may not work for another.

Forcing an entire organization to follow a prescriptive set of practices such as 2 week sprints and story points for estimating work, is a great way to appear like you're doing Agile. It's also a great way to waste a few years and convince teams Agile is not for them.

## Practices
To get started you should adopt three main practices:
1. Daily Stand-ups
2. Regular Retrospectives (Weekly or Bi-Weekly are best to start)
3. Tracking all work on a board (physical or virtual)

It's important to note there are LOADS of other practices that could be useful to your team. But it's important to start small and incrementally introduce change… and these three basic practices set you up to do just that!

There are loads of resources on how to run these meetings properly so I won't get into that. 

The goal is to ensure your team is communicating, there is a platform to suggest, make and track change, and that the flow of work and pain points are visible to the team and the stakeholders outside the team. More on the last one in my next post!
